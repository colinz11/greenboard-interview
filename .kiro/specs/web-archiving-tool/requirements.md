# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building an end-to-end web archiving tool similar to the Wayback Machine. The system will allow users to capture complete snapshots of websites, including all linked pages within the same domain, and preserve them for future access. The tool will support versioning, re-archiving, and provide a user-friendly interface for managing and viewing archived content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a URL and archive the entire website, so that I can preserve a complete snapshot of the site at a specific point in time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid URL in the input field THEN the system SHALL accept the URL and initiate the archiving process
2. WHEN the archiving process starts THEN the system SHALL fetch the content of the target page including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images
3. WHEN processing the main page THEN the system SHALL recursively discover and fetch all pages linked within the same domain
4. WHEN fetching linked pages THEN the system SHALL preserve the original structure and functionality of each page
5. WHEN all assets are collected THEN the system SHALL store them in a way that maintains the site's appearance and functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a list of all archived versions of a website, so that I can access historical snapshots and track changes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a website has been archived THEN the system SHALL create a timestamped entry for that archive
2. WHEN viewing the archive list THEN the system SHALL display all archived versions with their capture timestamps
3. WHEN a user selects a specific timestamp THEN the system SHALL serve the archived snapshot from that point in time
4. WHEN serving archived content THEN the system SHALL ensure all assets load correctly and the site functions as it did originally
5. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL organize them chronologically for easy navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually trigger new archives of previously archived websites, so that I can capture updated snapshots on demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an archived website THEN the system SHALL provide a "Re-archive" or "Update Archive" control
2. WHEN the user triggers a re-archive THEN the system SHALL fetch the current version of the website
3. WHEN re-archiving completes THEN the system SHALL create a new timestamped entry while preserving previous versions
4. WHEN multiple archives exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to compare different versions
5. WHEN re-archiving fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain existing archives

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various web assets correctly, so that archived pages look and function identically to the original sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN archiving a page THEN the system SHALL capture and store HTML content with proper encoding
2. WHEN processing stylesheets THEN the system SHALL download and store CSS files while maintaining relative path references
3. WHEN handling JavaScript THEN the system SHALL preserve scripts and their functionality within the archived context
4. WHEN encountering images THEN the system SHALL download and store all image assets referenced by the pages
5. WHEN serving archived content THEN the system SHALL rewrite URLs to point to locally stored assets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can easily manage my web archives without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL present a clear input field for entering URLs
2. WHEN archiving is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and status updates
3. WHEN viewing archives THEN the system SHALL provide an organized list with clear timestamps and site identifiers
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
5. WHEN navigating archived content THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators that the user is viewing archived content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the archiving process is reliable and robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering invalid URLs THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide clear error messages
2. WHEN facing network timeouts THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with reasonable limits
3. WHEN discovering circular links THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite loops while ensuring complete coverage
4. WHEN storage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and management options
5. WHEN external resources fail to load THEN the system SHALL continue archiving available content and log missing assets

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be well-structured and maintainable, so that it can be easily extended and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use React with clean component architecture
2. WHEN building the backend THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs for all archiving operations
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL organize archived content in a logical file structure or database schema
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL manage multiple archiving operations safely
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation and setup instructions
